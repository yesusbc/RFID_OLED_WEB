# RFID_OLED_WEB
Instead of calling the roll traditionally, this method propose system that uses students cards' ID, an RFID lector and an OLED display for a nice human interaction.

A very cheap and easy system, and the best of all... it's all mounted only on a *Node MCU*.

### 2. Recognize an student RFID card
When an student approachs and place its card above the lector, the circuit will recognize the credential and it will display a sand clock, which means it's loading.

### 3. Send data to database
A check mark will appear when the reading was succesfull and the data was sent to database.
